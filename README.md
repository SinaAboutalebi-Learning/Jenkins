# Jenkins Playground ‚ú®

Welcome to my Jenkins Playground! This repository serves as a tutorial and documentation hub for learning and experimenting with Jenkins.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Jenkins, follow these simple steps:

1. **Pull the Jenkins Docker image**: This command will fetch the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Jenkins with JDK 11 pre-installed.
    ```bash
    docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
    ```

2. **Create a Jenkins container**: Run the following command to create a Docker container named "jenkins" based on the Jenkins image you just pulled. This command also exposes ports 8080 and 50000, maps a volume for persistent data, and sets the container to restart automatically on failure.
    ```bash
    docker run -itd --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --restart=on-failure -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
    ```

3. **Access Jenkins Web UI**: Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://DockerHostIP:8080`. You will be greeted with the Jenkins unlock page.

4. **Get the Initial Admin Password**: To proceed with the installation, you need to retrieve the initial admin password. Execute the following command to obtain it:
    ```bash
    docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```

5. **Follow the Installation Wizard**: Copy and paste the initial admin password obtained in the previous step into the Jenkins unlock page and click "Continue" to proceed with the installation wizard.

6. **Install Recommended Plugins**: In the next step of the installation wizard, you'll be prompted to install recommended plugins. Choose either "Install suggested plugins" to install the default set of plugins or "Select plugins to install" to customize your installation.

7. **Create an Admin User**: After plugin installation, you'll be prompted to set up your admin user account. Provide the required details and click "Save and Finish" to complete the setup.

8. **Start Using Jenkins**: Once the setup is complete, you'll be redirected to the Jenkins dashboard, where you can start creating and managing your projects.


## Creating Your First Pipeline üöÄ

In this section, we'll guide you through creating your first pipeline in Jenkins using the web interface:

1. **Navigate to New Item**: On the left menu of the Jenkins dashboard, click on "New Item".

2. **Name Your Pipeline**: Enter a name for your pipeline, then select "Freestyle project" as the project type. For now, we'll start with a simple freestyle project.

3. **Configure Source Control Management (SCM)**: Under the "Source Control Management" section, choose "Git" and provide the repository URL. Make sure to change the default branch specifier from "*/master" to "*/main" if your repository uses the main branch as the default.

4. **Build Triggers**: Due to potential difficulties with configuring GitHub webhooks for Jenkins behind a NAT or firewall, we'll opt for the "Poll SCM" option instead. This method periodically checks the source code repository for changes, similar to a cron job, ensuring that Jenkins can detect and trigger builds even in restrictive network environments.

5. **Build Environment**: Consider enabling "Delete workspace before build starts" to ensure a clean build environment for each execution.

6. **Build and Post-Build Actions**:
    - **Build**: For our first build step, let's use a simple shell command. Select "Execute shell" from the list of build steps and enter the command `echo "Hello World"`. This will output "Hello World" when the build is executed.
    - **Post-Build**: You can add post-build actions such as sending an email notification upon build completion. For simplicity, we'll skip this step for now.

7. **Save and Build**: Once you've configured your pipeline settings, click "Save" to save the configuration. Then, click on "Build Now" to trigger the first build of your pipeline.

Congratulations! üéâ You've successfully created and executed your first Jenkins pipeline. You should see the build status and output in the Jenkins dashboard.
